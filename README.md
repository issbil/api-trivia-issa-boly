# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

That's where you come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application :

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## Instructions to use in local with Windows OS:

1. Clone repository
   1. git clone https://github.com/issbil/api-trivia-issa-boly.git
2. Install requirements from requirements.txt
   1. cd backend
   2. $ pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Create two databases trivia and trivia_test by using **setup.sql** and **trivia.psql** files
   1. psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -f setup.sql
   2. psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d trivia -f trivia.psql
   3. psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d trivia_test -f trivia.psql
   
4. Execution (**Backend**)
    1. set FLASK_APP=flaskr
    2. set FLASK_DEBUG=true
    3. flask run
   
5. Execution (**Frontend**)
   1. Install Node JS
   2. cd frontend
   3. npm install
   4. npm start
   5. tape **127.0.0.1:3000** in a browser


## API Reference

### Getting Started
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable 

### Endpoints
